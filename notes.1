notes on trying to bisect dplyr

first commit on master that 0.8.5 is descended from: b7f4f4dfb4. 
check it out and install_local ("dplyr") after running rstudio (set DISPLAY=:1) in ~/tim. needs more ram: runs out!

Confirmed that HEAD fails and the first commit succeeds. If I'm going to bisect this, it may make sense to put the repo on the mac, rather than the vm home directory

accpted man and tests. tests still don't work. accepted c++. mtcars %> etc does plot. run into  some rate  limitinig on getting code from github


looks like the code that went from R/group_keys.R is what's causing the breakage. This/these have been moved to R/group_data.R and changed somewhat. It should be possible to accpet t
rest of the files, with possible amends ot NAMESPACE and it work ok.


just pulled the fiiles apart from group_keys as I think that's got the culprit iin it. May not have pulled them correclty as will not build in rstudio :-(

got a response on the Issue, and a fix. ddplyr::groups() has changed if no groups were found, it used to return a null. Now it returns a zero length list. The rendering(?) 
(in vega.R) checks for is.null.
