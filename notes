- next step: check with f32 + current shiny (avoids guest additions). I think that this works, but seems flakey
- trying to get to safe working state. may need to go to prior to snapahot, if this does not work, as I don't know what to trust!

- move back to snapshot on master (notably version of install.R) try to source this. 
-- First go is with CRAN packages only. [fail]
-- Next is with 3 (None) [installs 18 packages, rather than 23, for CRAN] [fail, rlang]
-- Next is wiith 1 (ALL) [fail]

=> last checkout is NOT a working model!

trial with specific ggvis version, as letting R choose seems to break stuff!

edit install.R to install ggvis version early, as per 800055e9a3. Need to vagrant rsync to get this across. failed first time, retrying after explicit rsync (:-( ). Trying 3 (None), this time as istr that this is what avoids rlang - could be wrong.
At least ggvis appears to work with a 3 as it got past it in install.R

A question. Assuming that ggvis did get installed at a good version, what's the point in continuing with the other packages?
Is the ggvis installation with anythign other then "NONE" invalid?

NOT WORKING:
-try manual with just ggvis/None (fails with rlang on library(ggvis)), ggvis 2 (cran) (fails on library(ggvis) with rlang error), ggvis/empty line?(fail), ggvis/ All (fail), then:
 - go back to last good checkout and retry with that from vagrant up, rather than snapshot.

gone back to checkpoint 800055e9a3dd7fce581c30b49e73e78d7c909273 and vagrant destroy/up. The move with install.R (I think, although there could be gaps).

errors witth apparent issue with devtools, but it seems to be installed. manual install and start of rstudio-server, when used with browser this shows devtools installed (can just require it)
then install.packages("ggvis"): -fails no package shiny for it?, so use install_version (from install.R), need to dnf install R-Rcpp-devel..retry install_version [option 3: no updates]
this failed: ggvis loaded, but did not put dots on the screen!!! let's try with option 1 (all)
ditto when ggvis failed because of lack of shiny and explicit shiny install.

now with specific version of ggvis, as per earlier install.R
still getting rlang error,*but* if I restart R, ggvis works and doesn't coomplain.

let's try the restore snapshot: fails: was deleted with early `vagrant destroy`.

Trying the snapshot/restore + ggvis explicit version + R reset

snapshot b4 installing rstudio-server and R-Rcpp-devel, using 1 (all) on installations
works.
now to start from the snapshot beyond dnf and pull out some of the packages
- first attempt had blank line after `source ("/vagrant/iinstall.R"), so minimal upgrades, and again on second request - comes up with rlang error. need to verify impact of not just leaving blank line, but of updating some more packages

- narrowed down to dplyr (+ggvis) as the issue. Validating that shiny not necessary - shiny does not fix it alone. Then try current ggvis with older dplyr. nb the version of ggvis seems to be newer than the latest release tag on github (?)

interestingly, post restore snapshot from post dnf, no login on refresh on browser?

now I'm really unclear. `package.install ("ggvis"), plus version_install ("dplyr", version=0.8.3)` has no dots in the plot. but if I restart the R session, it works. Is there soemthing in how R loads libraries? It distinguishes between `attached packages` and `loaded via a namespace (and not attached)`????

If so, then I think that install.packages("ggvis") ought to fail even with R reset:
